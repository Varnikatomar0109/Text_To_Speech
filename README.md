# Text_To_Speech
This Text-to-Speech (TTS) Converter is a Python application that converts written text into natural-sounding speech. Using the gTTS (Google Text-to-Speech) library, the program allows users to input text, which is then converted into spoken words and optionally saved as an audio file (MP3 format).
